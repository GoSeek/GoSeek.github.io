	I have no programming experience. I am an artistic person, and have several years of experience creating graphics in 
	Photoshop. I won’t claim to be a “Graphic Designer”, but to lead you to believe that I had not designed graphics would 
	be a lie. Over the years, I made made a few friends on Photoshop forums that later became professional developers and 
	designers. Because of that, I already had a solid understanding of the lingo and basic work flow of web development before 
	starting this journey. However, I had not participated in development.
</p>
<p>
	I am interested in Ruby on Rails because I want to make my dreams a reality. I think of things non-stop. I’m a creative. 
	Those creative gears are always turning. I have  so many ideas for websites, applications, communities, and programs! I tried several 
	times to learn a programming language. I made an attempt into PHP more than once. I made several attempts at Python and also 
	failed to grasp it - barely making it past “Hello World” before giving up.
</p>
<p>
	And so I began to think that without a lot of money, I’d never be able to see any of my ideas come to life. An artistic guy
	like me? Having almost no knowledge of math? Possessing no aptitude for learning how to program? I thought those ideas would
	sit inside my head until I saw someone else implement them and profit both emotionally and monetarily.
</p>
<p>
	As a beginner, it’s really hard to contribute something productive to the Ruby/Rails community. 
	I make my best effort by submitting typos and misprints that I’ve found in learning resources. 
	I thought starting a blog to document my journey and share my thoughts might be another excellent 
	way to contribute in some way, as it could serve to motivate others in the future. I encourage all
	fellow beginners to do that as well.
</p>
<p>
	I have been tracking my hours spent on strictly Ruby and Rails related learning so that I can give a
	hard amount of hours to anyone looking for this information. I’d like to be able to have a good estimate
	of how many hours it took of learning before I felt confident, before I made something with X functionality 
	on my own, and before I applied or got hired to different types of jobs. I also want to share my studying routine.

</p>
<p>
	I am not good at math. Actually, I’m very bad at math. Although, I’m starting to think of that as a failure in learning and 
	not in brainpower. The last U.S. grade that I completed in school was 7th, and I was in “LD” (learning disability) classes for 
	most of those years. So, it’s safe to say that I really don’t know much about math. You have no reason to fear programming just 
	because you’re bad at math. I’ll likely write about this more as I conquer the more advanced parts of programming and can speak 
	more accurately about those specific struggles.
</p>
<p>
	The hours logged in this blog are specific to Ruby on Rails. Hours spent learning Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS are logged
	but not included in the total hours count.
